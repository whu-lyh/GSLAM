\section sIntro Introduction

The %GSLAM library is a set of C++11 header files which provide basic facilities:
	- @link GSLAM::Estimator Estimator@endlink
	- @link GSLAM::Optimizer Optimizer@endlink
	- @link GSLAM::Vocabular Vocabular@endlink

Estimator aims to provide a collection of close-form solvers cover all interesting cases with robust
sample consensus (RANSAC); Optimizer aims to provide an unified interface for popular nonlinear SLAM
problems; Vocabulary aims to provide an efficient and portable bag of words implementation for place
recolonization with multi-thread and SIMD optimization.


\section sUsage How to use GSLAM
